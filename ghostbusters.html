                    <P>SYNOPSIS:Thirty-two years after defeating Vigo the Carpathian, the Ghostbusters have disbanded after a decline in supernatural activities in New York City. Egon Spengler has relocated to Summerville, Oklahoma, where Gozerian cultist Ivo Shandor's mining operations are located. Egon captures a bestial entity from Shandor's mine, aiming to lure a more powerful entity to a painstaking trap in his farm. When the trap's capacitors fail, he hides the ghost trap that caught his captive under his farmhouse's living room floor. Egon struggles with another entity and suffers a fatal heart attack.

Callie, Egon's estranged daughter, and her two children, Trevor and Phoebe, are evicted from their apartment and move to Egon's farm, which he has left to Callie. Trevor meets a local girl, Lucky, and gets a job at the diner where she works. Phoebe is enrolled in a summer science class at a local middle school. Her mentor is eccentric seismologist Gary Grooberson, whom Callie later dates.

Phoebe discovers the house is haunted and finds a PKE meter under Egon's chair. An unseen ghost leads her to the hidden ghost trap, while Trevor finds and repairs the dilapidated Ecto-1 vehicle. Lucky takes Trevor to an old mine shaft with her friends, where they encounter a glowing apparition. Phoebe shows the ghost trap to her new friend, Podcast, and Gary reveals he is a fan of the Ghostbusters, conducting his own investigation on Summerville. Despite not sitting on an epicenter, the town has been consistently experiencing strange earthquakes. Gary, Phoebe, and Podcast tamper with the ghost trap, and the bestial entity, revealed to be one of otherworldly immortal Gozer's minions, escapes into Shandor's mine.

The ghost haunting Egon's farm leads Phoebe to an underground laboratory where Egon kept his equipment. Realizing the ghost is her grandfather, Phoebe restores the Ghostbusters' proton packs under his direction. She and Podcast test one after when they encounter Muncher, an extremotrophic ghost, but it escapes into Summerville. After Phoebe informs Trevor that their grandfather was a Ghostbuster, the trio chase Muncher with the Ecto-1 and capture it. However, they are blamed for the damage caused during Muncher's rampage and the police arrest them, confiscating the Ghostbusters' gear. Phoebe phones Ray Stantz; he explains that when Egon's teammates doubted his belief in a coming apocalypse, he stole the car and gear and moved to Summerville.

Trevor, Phoebe, Lucky, and Podcast find a temple dedicated to Gozer inside the mine that also serves as a gateway between dimensions. They also find Ivo Shandor (in suspended animation), and a device Egon built to hinder Gozer with crossed proton streams, whose escape attempts from the portal are causing the earthquakes. Gary and Callie are possessed by Gozer's minions Vinz Clortho the Keymaster and Zuul the Gatekeeper, respectively, and Vinz destroys Egon's containment device, causing an interdimensional cataclysm that enables Gozer and Shandor to rise; the former then kills the latter. The kids discover Egon's trap for Gozer and, donning the Ghostbusters jumpsuits, they retrieve the confiscated gear to enact his plan. Phoebe distracts Gozer and Podcast traps Zuul, freeing Callie and causing Gozer's form to falter. They lure Gozer to Egon's farm to ambush it, but the trap again malfunctions, and the Mini-Pufts sabotage the equipment in the Ecto-1, allowing Gozer to free Zuul. Zuul possesses Lucky, and Gozer is restored.

Ray arrives with Peter Venkman and Winston Zeddemore to aid the Spenglers and their friends, but Gozer counters the Ghostbusters' tactics. Phoebe battles Gozer herself, enabling everyone to regroup, and Egon's ghost materializes beside his granddaughter to help. Phoebe and the Ghostbusters restrain Gozer while Podcast destroys the Mini-Pufts and Trevor charges the trap's capacitors with a proton stream, which triggers the ghost traps, capturing Gozer and its minions. Egon reconciles with his family and friends before vanishing into the afterlife. After getting acquainted with the group, the surviving original Ghostbusters return to New York City with the Ecto-1 and equipment.

Venkman and Dana Barrett play with Venkman's ESP cards and shock machine. Winston, now a wealthy family man, uses his resources to maintain the Ghostbusters' properties. On the Ghostbusters' firehouse's ecto-containment unit, a warning light blinks.</P>
