        <h3>MACDONALD</h3>
        <P>McDonald's is the world's largest restaurant chain by revenue, serving over 69 million customers daily in over 100 countries across 37,855 outlets as of 2018. Although McDonald's is best known for its hamburgers, cheeseburgers and french fries, they feature chicken products, breakfast items, soft drinks, milkshakes, wraps, and desserts. In response to changing consumer tastes and a negative backlash because of the unhealthiness of their food, the company has added to its menu salads, fish, smoothies, and fruit. The McDonald's Corporation revenues come from the rent, royalties, and fees paid by the franchisees, as well as sales in company-operated restaurants. According to two reports published in 2018, McDonald's is the world's second-largest private employer with 1.7 million employees (behind Walmart with 2.3 million employees).As of 2020, McDonald's has the ninth-highest global brand valuation.[.McDonald’s opened its first restaurant in South Africa in November 1995. Today, we operate over 300 restaurants in nine of South Africa’s provinces.

McDonald’s is renowned for its training throughout the world. We have trained and employed over 12 000 South Africans at various levels, including franchisees, restaurant managers and crew. Currently more than 80% of all food served in McDonald’s restaurants is produced by local South African suppliers (according to our highest quality standards). The Muslim Judicial Council Halaal Trust approves all of our SA restaurants.
