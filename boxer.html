        <h3>BOXER</h3>
<P>Boxer is one of the fastest growing discount supermarkets in Southern Africa. With a cemented set of ‘people centered’ goals and values, we have positioned ourselves as ‘Africa’s Favourite Discount Supermarket’ - a discounter that caters for the needs of the enlarged middle to lower income consumer market. Since our beginnings, more than four decades ago in 1977, in KwaZulu-Natal’s Empangeni community, the Boxer brand has grown far and wide and includes well defined retail offerings that boast stores spread in every province of South Africa, as well as in the Kingdom of eSwatini (Swaziland).

Retail giant Pick n Pay acquired Boxer in 2002 in order for the Group to best serve the consumer market place that Boxer continues to dominate in. Boxer actively seeks opportunities with established brands to further entrench accessibility to its consumers. With Boxer’s long serving and stable Directorate & Executive teams who are second to none in today’s ever evolving business landscape, the Boxer group has the effectiveness and efficiency of being able to operate independently from the greater Group. Through Boxer’s noticeable growth over the decades it continues to provide an array of company formats across a defined set of models, ranging from a full service discount supermarket; to an ‘everything under one roof’ builders’ hardware offering; through to a liquor store format. Boxer is not a ‘cash & carry’ nor is it a ‘wholesaler.’

Boxer is a fully fledged retailer across all its formats, selling products and services at discounted prices. The Company serves a diverse consumer base, from the daily household shopper who travels by car, through to customers who choose public transport to get to ‘Africa’s Favourite Discount Supermarket.’’ Over four decades of trading is testimony to the accelerated forward thinking and determined enthusiasm of the Boxer Company across all of its trading formats. Boxer’s progressive drive sees the business continuously evolving itself to ensure that all of its offerings not only match, but surpass the retail industry benchmarks.</P>
