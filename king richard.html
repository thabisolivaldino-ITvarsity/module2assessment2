                    <P>SYNOPSIS:Richard Williams is raising his two daughters, Venus and Serena, plus his three step-daughters in Compton, California. Venus competes in ITF Junior Circuit before going pro in 1994 at the age of 14. Richard expresses hesitation about her going pro, to the chagrin of her mother. Richard soon changes his mind and signs up both his daughters with coach Rick Macci. The family move to Florida once the two daughters become professional players. Venus competes against Arantxa SÃ¡nchez Vicario from Spain in 1994. Nine months later, she signs a contract with Reebok.</P>
